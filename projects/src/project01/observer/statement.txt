    For the observer design pattern I chose to implement a deposit of products. There are 2 ways in which the products
from the deposit can be viewed: their complete name and description, or their type. The client can chose which view,
depending on his preferences. For example, he might be interested to see if there are any headphones in the deposit,
and only if there are, he might want to look at each headphone in detail.
    The observable in this case is the deposit, and the observers are the 2 views in which a customer can look at the
products from the deposit. In this way, the products are only in the Deposit class, and each view contains the needed
details of the products. When a new product is added in the deposit, the views will be notified to update themselves.
