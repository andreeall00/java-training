    I chose to implement an application for a teahouse in order to provide a concrete implementation for the decorator
design pattern.
    The teahouse has for now water and 3 types of teas: black tea, red tea and green tea. Each customer can choose to
add milk, sugar, a cookie, or any combination of these 3. This would mean that there would be necessary to have a class
for each possible combination of the add-ons. Seeing that the teahouse could develop further more, it could also offer
the possibility to add vanilla or other flavours, which would be really difficult to manage in this way.
    Here is when the decorator design patter would come in handy. Using it, you would only have to implement the
abstract class AddOn from which each type of add-on would inherit, getting rid of the classes of the combinations of
add-ons.
